		<p>Born in San Luis Obispo, CA. I moved to Boston one year ago to work for the non-profit organization City Year. I have spent the last year working with youth in the classroom providing strategic tutoring interventions and planning and facilitating an after school program curriculum to further students learning. But alas! As my time with City Year is coming to an end I must look for possible paths for my future. I stumbled across computer programing on <a href="http://www.khanacademy.com">Khan Academy</a> and quickly fell in love. In less than a month I have learned the basics of Java Script and created my own game and learned the basics of html and css and created my own website! And now I am currently learning the fundamentals of Ruby. I love programing. <span>Problem solving and using my own creativity?</span> I can't believe I didn't start learning programing earlier! Now all I want to do is further my learning and get out into the field. Which is exactly why I am applying to <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com">Launch Academy</a> in Boston. After doing some research, I am confident that Launch Academy will provide the perfect atmosphere to unlock my coding potential. I am a fast-pace learner and I thrive in fast-pace, continual learning environments. That is how I know that once accepted into Launch Academy I will not only meet the standards but <span>surpace my own expectations and leave with the skills I need to be a powerful member of a developement team</span>.   </p>
